# FlashFX Export System Documentation

## Overview

The FlashFX export system has been completely rewritten to provide a robust, reliable, and optimized design export feature. The new system supports three export modes with real-time progress tracking and comprehensive error handling.

## Architecture

### Module Structure

The export system is organized into modular components located in `/src/export/`:

```
/src/export/
├── ExportManager.ts      # Orchestrates all export operations
├── CanvasExporter.ts     # Handles full canvas exports
├── ShapeExporter.ts      # Handles individual shape exports
├── ZipExporter.ts        # Handles ZIP file creation
└── ExportUI.tsx          # User interface component
```

## Features

### 1. Export Entire Canvas

- Exports the complete canvas as a single PNG or JPEG image
- Supports custom resolution selection:
  - Canvas native resolution
  - Full HD (1920×1080)
  - 4K (3840×2160)
  - 8K (7680×4320)
  - Custom width/height
- Uses 2x pixel ratio for high-quality output
- Transparent background for PNG, solid for JPEG

### 2. Export ZIP for Animation

**Most Important Feature**

- Exports each visible shape individually as a PNG with transparent background
- Each shape maintains its exact position on the canvas
- When overlaid, shapes recreate the original canvas perfectly
- Naming convention: `[projectName]_shape_00.png`, `[projectName]_shape_01.png`, etc.
- Shapes are exported in layer stack order (bottom to top)
- All exports automatically packaged into a ZIP file
- Optimized rendering to prevent memory issues

### 3. Export Selection

- Exports only selected elements
- Single selection: Downloads as individual PNG
- Multiple selections: Creates ZIP file with all selected shapes
- Same quality and positioning guarantees as ZIP export

## User Interface

### Toolbar Integration

The export button is located in the toolbar next to the Settings button:
- Icon: Upload icon (box with arrow out)
- Tooltip: "Export Design"
- Same styling as other toolbar buttons
- Keyboard shortcut compatible

### Export Modal

When clicked, a modal appears with:

1. **Format Selection**
   - PNG (Transparent) - default
   - JPEG

2. **Resolution Options**
   - Canvas resolution
   - Preset resolutions (HD, 4K, 8K)
   - Custom width/height inputs

3. **Export Mode Buttons**
   - Export Entire Canvas (Blue button)
   - Export ZIP for Animation (Yellow/Orange gradient - primary)
   - Export Selection (Gray button, disabled if nothing selected)

### Progress Tracking

During export, the modal displays:
- Real-time progress indicator
- Current shape being exported (e.g., "Exporting shape 3/25: Rectangle")
- Progress bar with percentage
- Estimated time remaining
- Non-blocking UI (panels remain usable)
- Canvas interaction is locked during export

### Completion States

**Success:**
- Green checkmark icon
- Success message
- File name displayed
- "Done" button to close

**Error:**
- Red error icon
- Error message
- Technical error details
- "Retry" button
- "Close" button

## Technical Implementation

### Canvas Export Process

1. Locates canvas DOM element by ID (`canvas-artboard`)
2. Uses `html-to-image` library with `toPng` or `toJpeg`
3. Applies 2x pixel ratio for quality
4. Captures at specified resolution
5. Downloads directly to user's system

### Shape Export Process

1. Iterates through visible shapes in layer order
2. For each shape:
   - Creates temporary container with full canvas dimensions
   - Clones the DOM element
   - Positions clone at exact canvas coordinates
   - Renders with transparent background
   - Captures as PNG with `html-to-image`
   - Converts to Blob
3. Collects all Blobs
4. Packages into ZIP using JSZip
5. Downloads ZIP file using FileSaver

### Performance Optimizations

- Sequential rendering prevents memory overflow
- Efficient blob management
- ZIP compression level 6 for balance of speed and size
- Temporary DOM cleanup after each export
- Progress callback system prevents UI freezing

### Error Handling

- Graceful failure for individual shapes
- Detailed error messages
- Memory overflow detection
- Missing element warnings
- Retry capability

## Integration Points

### UIDesignTool Component

```typescript
import ExportUI from '../export/ExportUI';

<ExportUI
  isOpen={showExportPanel}
  onClose={() => setShowExportPanel(false)}
  elements={currentState.elements}
  selectedElements={currentState.selectedElements}
  projectName={projectName}
  canvasWidth={3840}
  canvasHeight={2160}
/>
```

### Toolbar Component

```typescript
{onOpenExport && (
  <button
    onClick={onOpenExport}
    className="p-2 rounded-lg bg-gray-700/50 hover:bg-gray-600/50"
    title="Export Design"
  >
    <Upload className="w-5 h-5" />
  </button>
)}
```

## Usage Guide

### For Users

1. **Export Entire Canvas:**
   - Click Export button in toolbar
   - Select format and resolution
   - Click "Export Entire Canvas"
   - File downloads automatically

2. **Export for Animation:**
   - Click Export button
   - Select desired resolution
   - Click "Export ZIP for Animation"
   - Wait for progress to complete
   - ZIP file downloads with all shapes

3. **Export Selection:**
   - Select one or more shapes
   - Click Export button
   - Click "Export Selection"
   - Single shape downloads as PNG
   - Multiple shapes download as ZIP

### For Developers

To modify export behavior:

1. **Add new export mode:**
   - Add to `ExportMode` type in `ExportManager.ts`
   - Implement export function in ExportManager
   - Add UI button in `ExportUI.tsx`

2. **Change default settings:**
   - Modify initial state in `ExportUI.tsx`
   - Update `ExportConfig` interface

3. **Add format support:**
   - Add to format type in ExportConfig
   - Implement in CanvasExporter
   - Add UI option

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with Canvas API support
- File download API support required
- Blob API support required
- Tested in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

## Known Limitations

- Very large canvases (>8K) may cause memory issues
- Export speed depends on element count and complexity
- Maximum recommended: 100 shapes per export
- Browser file size limits apply

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- SVG export support
- PDF export
- Video export integration
- Batch project export
- Cloud export destinations
- Export presets
- Background export (web workers)

## Dependencies

- `html-to-image` - Canvas to image conversion
- `jszip` - ZIP file creation
- `file-saver` - File download handling
- React - UI framework
- Lucide React - Icons

## Troubleshooting

### Export fails immediately
- Check console for errors
- Verify elements have valid DOM nodes
- Ensure canvas element exists

### Memory errors
- Reduce canvas resolution
- Export fewer shapes at once
- Close other browser tabs

### Shapes positioned incorrectly
- Verify element x/y coordinates
- Check for transform issues
- Ensure parent containers are correct

### ZIP file corrupt
- Check available disk space
- Verify all blobs created successfully
- Try smaller batch size

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check console logs for detailed errors
2. Verify all dependencies installed
3. Test with simple shapes first
4. Review export progress messages
